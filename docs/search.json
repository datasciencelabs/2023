    "text": "20.3 Conditional expectations\nSuppose we are asked to guess the height of a randomly selected son and we don’t know his father’s height. How do we do this?\nMathematically, we can show that the conditional expectation\n\\[\nf(x) = \\mbox{E}(Y \\mid X = x)\n\\]\nminimizes the expected squared error (MSE):\n\\[\n\\mbox{E}[\\{Y -f(X)\\}^2]\n\\] with \\(x\\) representing the fixed value that defines that subset, for example 72 inches.\nWe denote the standard deviation of the strata with\n\\[\n\\mbox{SD}(Y \\mid X = x) = \\sqrt{\\mbox{Var}(Y \\mid X = x)}\n\\]\nBecause the conditional expectation \\(E(Y\\mid X=x)\\) is the best predictor for the random variable \\(Y\\) for an individual in the strata defined by \\(X=x\\), many data science challenges reduce to estimating this quantity. The conditional standard deviation quantifies the precision of the prediction.\nHowever, we oftern have a limited number of points to estimate this conditional expectation. For example\n\nsum(galton_heights$father == 72)\n\n[1] 8\n\n\nfathers that are exactly 72-inches. If we change the number to 72.5, we get even fewer data points:\n\nsum(galton_heights$father == 72.5)\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nA practical way to improve these estimates of the conditional expectations, is to define strata of with similar values of \\(x\\). In our example, we can round father heights to the nearest inch and assume that they are all 72 inches. If we do this, we end up with the following prediction for the son of a father that is 72 inches tall:\n\nconditional_avg &lt;- galton_heights |&gt; \n  filter(round(father) == 72) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg = mean(son)) |&gt; \n  pull(avg)\nconditional_avg\n\n[1] 70.5\n\n\nNote that a 72-inch father is taller than average but smaller than 72. We see the same for someoen slightly shorted than average:\n\nconditional_avg &lt;- galton_heights |&gt; \n  filter(round(father) == 67) |&gt;\n  summarize(avg = mean(son)) |&gt; \n  pull(avg)\nconditional_avg\n\n[1] 68.71818\n\n\nThe sons of have regressed some to the average height. We notice that the reduction in how many SDs taller is about 0.5, which happens to be the correlation. As we will see in a later section, this is not a coincidence.\nIf we want to make a prediction of any height, not just 72, we could apply the same approach to each strata. Stratification followed by boxplots lets us see the distribution of each group:\n\ngalton_heights |&gt; mutate(father_strata = factor(round(father))) |&gt; \n  ggplot(aes(father_strata, son)) + \n  geom_boxplot() + \n  geom_point()\n\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, the centers of the groups are increasing with height. Furthermore, these centers appear to follow a linear relationship. Below we plot the averages of each group. If we take into account that these averages are random variables with standard errors, the data is consistent with these points following a straight line:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fact that these conditional averages follow a line is not a coincidence. In the next section, we explain that the line these averages follow is what we call the regression line, which improves the precision of our estimates. However, it is not always appropriate to estimate conditional expectations with the regression line so we also describe Galton’s theoretical justification for using the regression line."

    "text": "20.6 Bivariate normal distribution\nCorrelation and the regression slope are a widely used summary statistic, but they are often misused or misinterpreted. Anscombe’s examples provide over-simplified cases of dataset in which summarizing with correlation would be a mistake. But there are many more real-life examples.\nThe main way we motivate the use of correlation involves what is called the bivariate normal distribution.\nWhen a pair of random variables is approximated by the bivariate normal distribution, scatterplots look like ovals. As we saw in Section Section 20.2), they can be thin (high correlation) or circle-shaped (no correlation.\nA more technical way to define the bivariate normal distribution is the following: if \\(X\\) is a normally distributed random variable, \\(Y\\) is also a normally distributed random variable, and the conditional distribution of \\(Y\\) for any \\(X=x\\) is approximately normal, then the pair is approximately bivariate normal. When three or more variables have the property that each pair is bivariate normal, we say the variables follow a multivariate normal distribution or that they are jointly normal.\nIf we think the height data is well approximated by the bivariate normal distribution, then we should see the normal approximation hold for each strata. Here we stratify the son heights by the standardized father heights and see that the assumption appears to hold:\n\ngalton_heights |&gt;\n  mutate(z_father = round((father - mean(father)) / sd(father))) |&gt;\n  filter(z_father %in% -2:2) |&gt;\n  ggplot() +  \n  stat_qq(aes(sample = son)) +\n  facet_wrap( ~ z_father) \n\n\n\n\nNow we come back to defining correlation. Galton used mathematical statistics to demonstrate that, when two variables follow a bivariate normal distribution, computing the regression line is equivalent to computing conditional expectations. We don’t show the derivation here, but we can show that under this assumption, for any given value of \\(x\\), the expected value of the \\(Y\\) in pairs for which \\(X=x\\) is:\n\\[\n\\mbox{E}(Y | X=x) = \\mu_Y +  \\rho \\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\\sigma_Y\n\\]\nThis is the regression line, with slope \\[\\rho \\frac{\\sigma_Y}{\\sigma_X}\\] and intercept \\(\\mu_y - m\\mu_X\\). It is equivalent to the regression equation we showed earlier which can be written like this:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\mbox{E}(Y \\mid X=x)  - \\mu_Y}{\\sigma_Y} = \\rho \\frac{x-\\mu_X}{\\sigma_X}\n\\]\nThis implies that, if our data is approximately bivariate, the regression line gives the conditional probability. Therefore, we can obtain a much more stable estimate of the conditional expectation by finding the regression line and using it to predict.\nIn summary, if our data is approximately bivariate, then the conditional expectation, the best prediction of \\(Y\\) given we know the value of \\(X\\), is given by the regression line."

But once we condition, we are only looking at the variability of the sons with a tall, 72-inch, father. This group will all tend to be somewhat tall so the standard deviation is reduced.\nSpecifically, it is reduced to \\(\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2} = \\sqrt{1 - 0.25}\\) = 0.87 of what it was originally. We could say that father heights “explain” 13% of the variability observed in son heights.\nThe statement “\\(X\\) explains such and such percent of the variability” is commonly used in academic papers. In this case, this percent actually refers to the variance (the SD squared). So if the data is bivariate normal, the variance is reduced by \\(1-\\rho^2\\), so we say that \\(X\\) explains \\(1- (1-\\rho^2)=\\rho^2\\) (the correlation squared) of the variance.\nBut it is important to remember that the “variance explained” statement only makes sense when the data is approximated by a bivariate normal distribution."

    "text": "20.9 Linear models\nLet’s learn about the connection between regression and linear models. We have described how if data is bivariate normal then the conditional expectations follow the regression line. The fact that the conditional expectation is a line is not an extra assumption but rather a derived result. However, in practice it is common to explicitly write down a model that describes the relationship between two or more variables using a linear model.\nlinear here does not refer to lines exclusively, but rather to the fact that the conditional expectation is a linear combination of known quantities. In mathematics, when we multiply each variable by a constant and then add them together, we say we formed a linear combination of the variables. For example,\n\\[3x - 4y + 5z\\]\nis a linear combination of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\nWe can also add a constant so\n\\[2 + 3x - 4y + 5z\\]\nis also linear combination of \\(x\\), \\(y\\), and \\(z\\).\nNote that if we write\n\\[\nY = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\varepsilon\n\\]\nthen if we assume \\(\\varepsilon\\) follows a normal distribution with expected value 0 and fixed standard deviation, then \\(Y\\) has the same properties as the regression setup gave us: it follows a normal distribution, the expected value is a linear function \\(x\\), and the standard deviation does not depend on \\(x\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIn statistical textbooks, the \\(\\varepsilon\\)s are referred to as “errors,” which originally represented measurement errors in the initial applications of these models. These errors were associated with inaccuracies in measuring height, weight, or distance. However, the term “error” is now used more broadly, even when the \\(\\varepsilon\\)s do not necessarily signify an actual error. For instance, in the case of height, if someone is 2 inches taller than expected based on their parents’ height, those 2 inches should not be considered an error. Despite its lack of descriptive accuracy, the term “error” is employed to elucidate the unexplained variability in the model, unrelated to other included terms.\n\n\nLinear model for Galton’s data, we would denote the \\(N\\) observed father heights with \\(x_1, \\dots, x_n\\), then we model the \\(N\\) son heights we are trying to predict with:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\, i=1,\\dots,N.\n\\]\nWe can further assume that \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) are independent from each other and all have the same standard deviation.\nTo have a useful model for prediction, we need \\(\\beta_0\\) and \\(\\beta_1\\). We estimate these from the data.\nAlthough this model is exactly the same one we derived earlier by assuming bivariate normal data, a somewhat nuanced difference is that in the first approach we assumed the data was bivariate normal and the linear model was derived, not assumed. In practice, linear models are just assumed without necessarily assuming normality: the distribution of the \\(\\varepsilon\\)s is not necessarily specified. Nevertheless, if your data is bivariate normal, the above linear model holds. If your data is not bivariate normal, then you will need to have other ways of justifying the model.\nOne reason linear models are popular is that they are interpretable. In the case of Galton’s data, we can interpret the data like this: due to inherited genes, the son’s height prediction grows by \\(\\beta_1\\) for each inch we increase the father’s height \\(x\\). Because not all sons with fathers of height \\(x\\) are of equal height, we need the term \\(\\varepsilon\\), which explains the remaining variability. This remaining variability includes the mother’s genetic effect, environmental factors, and other biological randomness.\nGiven how we wrote the model above, the intercept \\(\\beta_0\\) is not very interpretable as it is the predicted height of a son with a father with no height. Due to regression to the mean, the prediction will usually be a bit larger than 0. To make the slope parameter more interpretable, we can rewrite the model slightly as:\n\\[\nY_i = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 (x_i - \\bar{x}) + \\varepsilon_i, \\, i=1,\\dots,N\n\\]\nIn this case \\(\\beta_0\\) represents the height when \\(x_i = \\bar{x}\\), which is the height of the son of an average father."

Here is a plot of the RSS as a function of \\(\\beta_1\\) when we keep the \\(\\beta_0\\) fixed at 25.\n\nbeta1 = seq(0, 1, length = nrow(galton_heights))\nresults &lt;- data.frame(beta1 = beta1,\n                      rss = sapply(beta1, rss, beta0 = 25))\nresults |&gt; ggplot(aes(beta1, rss)) + geom_line() + \n  geom_line(aes(beta1, rss))\n\n\n\n\nWe can see a clear minimum for \\(\\beta_1\\) at around 0.65. However, this minimum for \\(\\beta_1\\) is for when \\(\\beta_0 = 25\\), a value we arbitrarily picked. We don’t know if (25, 0.65) is the pair that minimizes the equation across all possible pairs. We don’t need trial and error because we can use calculus."

    "text": "20.15 The regression fallacy\nWikipedia defines the sophomore slump as:\n\nA sophomore slump or sophomore jinx or sophomore jitters refers to an instance in which a second, or sophomore, effort fails to live up to the standards of the first effort. It is commonly used to refer to the apathy of students (second year of high school, college or university), the performance of athletes (second season of play), singers/bands (second album), television shows (second seasons) and movies (sequels/prequels).\n\nIn Major League Baseball, the rookie of the year (ROY) award is given to the first-year player who is judged to have performed the best. The sophmore slump phrase is used to describe the observation that ROY award winners don’t do as well during their second year. For example, this Fox Sports article asks “Will MLB’s tremendous rookie class of 2015 suffer a sophomore slump?”.\nDoes the data confirm the existence of a sophomore slump? Let’s take a look. Examining the data for widely used measure of success, the batting average, we see that this observation holds true for the top performing ROYs:\n\n\n\n\n\nnameFirst\nnameLast\nrookie_year\nrookie\nsophomore\n\n\n\n\nWillie\nMcCovey\n1959\n0.3541667\n0.2384615\n\n\nIchiro\nSuzuki\n2001\n0.3497110\n0.3214838\n\n\nAl\nBumbry\n1973\n0.3370787\n0.2333333\n\n\nFred\nLynn\n1975\n0.3314394\n0.3136095\n\n\nAlbert\nPujols\n2001\n0.3288136\n0.3135593\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn fact, the proportion of players that have a lower batting average their sophomore year is 0.6981132.\nSo is it “jitters” or “jinx”? To answer this question, let’s turn our attention to all players that played the 2013 and 2014 seasons and batted more than 130 times (minimum to win Rookie of the Year).\n\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'playerID'. You can override using the\n`.groups` argument.\n\n\nThe same pattern arises when we look at the top performers: batting averages go down for most of the top performers.\n\n\n\n\n\nnameFirst\nnameLast\n2013\n2014\n\n\n\n\nMiguel\nCabrera\n0.3477477\n0.3126023\n\n\nHanley\nRamirez\n0.3453947\n0.2828508\n\n\nMichael\nCuddyer\n0.3312883\n0.3315789\n\n\nScooter\nGennett\n0.3239437\n0.2886364\n\n\nJoe\nMauer\n0.3235955\n0.2769231\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut these are not rookies!

There is no such thing as the sophomore slump. This is all explained with a simple statistical fact: the correlation for performance in two separate years is high, but not perfect:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe correlation is 0.460254 and the data look very much like a bivariate normal distribution, which means we predict a 2014 batting average \\(Y\\) for any given player that had a 2013 batting average \\(X\\) with:\n\\[ \\frac{Y - .255}{.032} = 0.46 \\left( \\frac{X - .261}{.023}\\right) \\]\nBecause the correlation is not perfect, regression tells us that, on average, expect high performers from 2013 to do a bit worse in 2014. It’s not a jinx; it’s just due to chance. The ROY are selected from the top values of \\(X\\) so it is expected that \\(Y\\) will regress to the mean."

In preparation for the analysis of these data, we will obtain population estimates from the US Census by age and gender.\nWe will be using two different APIs as that is how the Census makes the data available. Important to note that in two of these APIs, all ages 85 or above are grouped into one group.\nIf you wish to skip this section (though you will lose points), you can obtain the already wrangled population data here.\n\nFirst step is to obtain a census key. You can request one here https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html. Once you have a key create a file in your directory called census-key.R that simply defines the variable census_key to be your personal key. Do not share this key publicly. The quarto file you turn in should not show your census key, instead it should source a file called census-key.R to define the variable. We will have a file on our end with our key so your script can knit.\nOnce you have your key you can use the httr2 package to download the data directly from the Census data base. We will start downloading the intercensus data from 2000-2009 (data dictionary here). We will download it only for Puerto Rico which has region ID 72. The following code downloads the data.\n\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://api.census.gov/data/2000/pep\"\nsource(\"census-key.R\")\nendpoint &lt;- paste0(\"int_charage?get=POP,SEX,AGE,DATE_&for=state:72&key=\", census_key)\nresponse &lt;- request(url) |&gt; \n  req_url_path_append(endpoint) |&gt;\n  req_perform()  \n\nThe data is now included in response and you can access it using the resp functions in httr2. Examine the results you obtain when applying resp_body_string. Write code to convert this into a data frame with columns names year, sex, age, and population and call it pop1. Hint: Use the function fromJSON from the jsonlite package. The functions row_to_names and clean_names from the janitor package might also be handy. Use the codebook to understand how the date column relates to year.\n\nNow we will obtain data for 2010-2019. The intercensal data is not available so we will use Vintage 2019 data (data dictionary here). We can follow a similar procedure but with the following API and endpoints:\n\n\nurl &lt;- \"https://api.census.gov/data/2019/pep\"\nsource(\"census-key.R\")\nendpoint &lt;- paste0(\"charage?get=POP,SEX,AGE,DATE_CODE&for=state:72&key=\", census_key)\n\nDownload the data and write code to convert this into a data frame with columns names year, sex, age, and population and call it pop2.\n\nCombine the data frames pop1 and pop2 created in the previous exercises to form one population data frame called population and including all year. Make sure the 85+ category is correctly computed on the two datasets. Save it to a file called population.rds in your rds."

Based on these data, what agegroups do you recommend we combine?\nCreate a new dataset called dat that collapses the counts into agegroups with enough deaths to fit a linear model. Remove any week with MMWR week 53 and add a column t that includes the number of weeks since the first week in the first year.\nWrite a function that receives a data frame tab, fits a linear model with a line for the time trend, and returns a data frame with 2017 data including a prediction.\nUse the group_modify function to fit this model to each sex and agegroup. Save the results in res.\nFor agegroup and by sex, plot the expected counts for each week with an error bar showing two standard deviations and in red the observed counts. Does the model appear to fit? Hint: Look to see if the red dots are inside the intervals before the hurricane.\nNow estimate weekly excess deaths for 2017 based on the rates esimated from 2002-2016 but the population sizes of 2017. Compare this to estimated standard deviation observed from year to year once we account for trends.\nPlot cummulative excess death for 2017 including a standard error."
